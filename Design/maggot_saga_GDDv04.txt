    - high standart office of scum executive

  - foreground / gameplay area
    - desk which define boundaries of playground

  - gui
    - stoned bar/indicator

# mechanics:
------------
  - crush
    - crushing the candies with every hit from smaller chunks to the dust (think asteroids)
    - crushing the maggots with one hit makes slime

  - sniff
    - sniffing dust selectively, avoiding bigger chunks of candies and maggots (think flight control)
    - sniffing dust glued with slime to desk is not possible
    - sniffing whole candies is not possible
    - sniffing bigger chunks of crushed candies jams the straw, can be unjamed by fist hit
    - sniffing maggot equals game over
